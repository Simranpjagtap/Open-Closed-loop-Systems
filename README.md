Welcome to the Control Systems repository! This repository contains comprehensive information and MATLAB Simulink models that explore both open-loop and closed-loop control systems.

## Overview
Control systems are integral to modern automation, ensuring efficiency, precision, and reliability across various applications. This repository provides detailed insights and practical examples of both open-loop and closed-loop systems.

## Open-Loop Systems
An open-loop system operates without feedback, meaning it cannot compensate for disturbances. It starts with an input transducer that converts the input form to be used by the controller, which then drives a process or plant. The output, or controlled variable, is directly influenced by the input without any correction for disturbances.

### Examples:

Toaster: A classic example of an open-loop system, where the toast is heated for a set time without adjusting for different types or thicknesses of bread.
Mechanical Systems: Systems consisting of a mass, spring, and damper with a constant force, where the position changes with disturbances without correction.

## Closed-Loop (Feedback Control) Systems
A closed-loop system uses feedback to adjust the control action, compensating for disturbances and ensuring the output remains at the desired level. The system measures the output response, feeds it back through a feedback path, and compares it to the input at the summing junction. Any difference, or error, drives the plant to make corrections.

### Examples:

Temperature Control System: Adjusts the output based on feedback from a sensor to maintain the desired temperature.
Advanced Toaster Oven: Measures the color and humidity of the toast to adjust the heating process.

#### MATLAB Simulink Models
This repository also includes MATLAB Simulink models that simulate various control systems. These models provide a hands-on approach to understanding the dynamics and behavior of open-loop and closed-loop systems, offering valuable insights into their design and implementation.
